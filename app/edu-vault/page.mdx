1. **Pending Topic:** Vault Token or a stablecoin implementation
2. **EDU Strategy** —> borrow tether with WEDU as collateral on Blend, and then just put that into the stablecoin strategy that we run
    1. Tell BLEND TO UP THE LTV A LOT FOR WEDU —> purchasing power
    2. reserve factor —> tell them to reduce it
3. Do we need to take both USDC and USDT and deal with that; or just force Pencil Finance to always give us USDT (my preferred solution)
    1. **Denomination:** USDT
    2. **Acceptable Assets:** 
        1. Do we create two vaults —> one for USDT and one for USDC.e
            1. need to consider how Pencil Fits into this with their USDC.e

The group is exploring ways to generate yield on the EDU token they hold, considering three main options: 1) Depositing EDU as collateral on Blend to borrow USDT and deploy that into a stablecoin yield strategy 04:58, 2) Shorting EDU and providing liquidity to an EDU DEX pool 07:06, and 3) Putting the EDU into a vault and borrowing against it 25:01. They are concerned about the capital efficiency and risks of these strategies, and want to find a scalable solution. 17:25

The group is also considering whether to create a stablecoin vault denominated in USDC, USDT, or both. There are pros and cons to each approach, with the USDC vault potentially being simpler but the USDT vault potentially earning higher yields. 51:45 They also discuss the challenges of integrating with Pencil Finance to accept both USDC and USDT, and whether to have the vault automatically convert USDC to USDT. 55:05

Overall, the meeting focused on exploring different strategies to generate yield on the EDU tokens and deciding on the best stablecoin structure for the vault, with the goal of finding a scalable and capital-efficient solution.
