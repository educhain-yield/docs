# USDT Staking Vault – EDUChain

---

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Increase Stablecoin TVL on EDUChain**
   - Attract USDT/USDC from Arbitrum and other chains.
   - Users mint OCUSD on EDUChain using bridged stables.
   - Restrict OCUSD withdrawals to EDUChain to retain liquidity.

2. **Deliver Sustainable Yield for Stablecoin Holders**
   - Deploy bridged stables into off-chain or L2 strategies.
   - Return yield manually via `REWARDER_ROLE` calls to on-chain vaults.

---

## 📝 Product Concept

Users deposit USDT → mint OCUSD → stake OCUSD → earn yield from externally deployed strategies like USDX.  
Yield is not streamed directly to users, but accumulates in the vault, increasing sOCUSD’s value over time.

- **Minting** can occur on **EDUChain or Arbitrum**
- **Redemption** is only available on **EDUChain**

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **OCUSD (ERC20 Stablecoin)**
  - Minted from USDT
  - Redeemable with cooldown
  - Minting restricted to whitelisted stablecoin types (USDT only on Day 1)

- **sOCUSD (ERC4626 Vault Token)**
  - Yield-bearing, capital-appreciating token
  - Cooldown + claim process for redemptions
  - Accumulated rewards reflected in increasing share value

- **Manual Yield Streaming**
  - External yield is deposited to the vault manually via `transferInRewards()`
  - Controlled by `REWARDER_ROLE` (multisig or backend agent)

- **Governance Parameters**
  - Configurable fees
  - Admin/minter role controls
  - Blacklist and pause functionality

- **Async Redemption**
  - Redemptions delayed (e.g. 24h) to prevent oracle mismatch arbitrage and enable backend unwinding of positions

---

## 🧩 Strategy Management

### Day 1 Setup
- Use a single yield strategy: **USDX** (requires USDT input)

### Future Flexibility
- Ability to:
  - Add new yield strategies
  - Deprecate or disable old ones
  - Reallocate funds between strategies

### Architecture
- Strategy registry or controller contract
- Strategy interface for plug-and-play backends
- Admin-governed list of active yield sources

### Governance
- Managed via `REWARDER_ROLE` and other role-based permissions
- NAV tracking and strategy enable/disable toggles

---

## 🔧 Smart Contract Requirements

### OCUSD (ERC20)

**P0**
- Mintable by whitelisted role
- Burn/redeem logic
- Admin role: pause, blacklist, governance settings

**P1**
- Optional OFT support (LayerZero compatibility)

---

### Minting / Buy Contract

**P0**
- `buy()`, `cooldown()`, `claim()`, `redeem()`
- Configurable fees
- Cooldown timing
- Accept USDT only (USDC excluded on Day 1)

---

### ERC4626 Vault (sOCUSD)

**P0**
- `cooldownAssets()` or `cooldownShares()`
- `claim()` or `unstake()` after delay
- `previewWithdraw()`, `getAmountByShares()`
- `transferInRewards()` callable by `REWARDER_ROLE`
- Governance configurability

---

## 🖥️ UI/UX Requirements

### Mint / Buy Page

**Inspiration**: USDX, Ethena, Anzen

**Features**
- Input: USDT → Output: OCUSD
- Conversion rates and slippage display
- Wallet + gas estimator
- Transaction preview
- Show “Max Slippage” and “Est. Gas”

---

### Stake Page – sOCUSD

**Features**
- Stake OCUSD → Receive sOCUSD
- Show APY, vault balance, sOCUSD price
- Cooldown + claim UX
- Yield graph or accumulated NAV growth

---

### Collateral / Transparency Page (V2)

**Features**
- OCUSD total collateral
- Yield strategy breakdown (e.g., USDX % exposure)
- Vault NAV and claim buffer
- Multisig yield logs (manual top-ups)

---

## 🔄 User Flow

### USDT Users

1. Deposit USDT  
2. Mint OCUSD (on Arbitrum or EDUChain)  
3. Stake OCUSD → Receive sOCUSD  
4. Yield accumulates over time (auto-compounded into share price)  
5. Initiate cooldown  
6. Claim OCUSD → Withdraw (on EDUChain only)

---

## ⏱ Redemption & Cooldown Logic

- **Minting** can be done on both **Arbitrum and EDUChain**
- **Redemption** must be completed on **EDUChain only**
- Cooldown period: **1 day**
- User initiates `cooldown()`, waits required time
- Calls `claim()` after cooldown period to redeem OCUSD
- Backend can unwind positions or sync oracle pricing in the interim

---

## 💱 Stablecoin Support

- **Day 1**: USDT only  
- **Future**: Optional USDC support via market rate conversion, with exchange rate risk caveats

---

## 🎯 Points System Considerations

- Day 1: Do not design around protocols offering points unless integrated manually
- Future: Consider allowing points tracking via:
  - Yield strategy metadata
  - External integration (Galxe, Dune, CSV export)
- Communicate to users if no points are supported

## 🧠 Notes

- Vault will operate in **manual mode** with **multisig custody** for launch.
- Future upgrade path: automate streaming + yield strategy management.
- Redemption will **not** be instant due to backend unwind requirements and oracle lag.
