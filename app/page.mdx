# Solen Protocol

Welcome to the official documentation for the Solen Protocol ‚Äî a suite of DeFi strategies built on top of the EDUChain ecosystem. This protocol leverages SailFish DEX and Blend Lending to deliver high-yield, capital-efficient strategies for $EDU, and $USDT holders.

## Overview

The Yield Vault Protocol provides automated vaults where users can deposit assets and earn yield through recursive lending strategies and token incentives. Each vault is isolated, transparent, and optimized for capital efficiency and safety.

This is a public-facing DeFi app with its own frontend, branding, and on-chain smart contracts.

## Key Features

- Strategy-based vaults (EDU, USDT)
- Automated recursive lending loops
- Modular and configurable vaults
- Oracle integration (for wsEDU)
- Emergency pause and withdrawal controls
- On-chain analytics: APY, LTV, earnings

## Vault Strategies

### Vault A: EDU Lending Loop (Vanilla)

- Input Asset: $EDU
- Looping Steps:
  1. Deposit $EDU into Blend
  2. Borrow $EDU (around 55% LTV)
  3. Re-deposit borrowed $EDU
  4. Repeat until target leverage (approximately 2.2x)
- Yield Sources:
  - 5% BLEND rewards on deposits
  - 5% BLEND rewards on borrows
  - Estimated APY: ~17%
- Output:
  - BLEND token rewards (claimable or stakeable)

### Vault B: USDT Positive Carry Loop (Stablecoin Strategy)

- Input Asset: $USDT
- Looping Steps:
  1. Deposit $USDT into Blend
  2. Borrow $USDT (around 75% LTV)
  3. Re-deposit borrowed $USDT
  4. Repeat until target leverage (approximately 4x)
- Yield Sources:
  - 2.5% BLEND rewards on deposits
  - 2.5% BLEND rewards on borrows
  - Estimated APY: ~17.5%
- Output:
  - BLEND token rewards (claimable or stakeable)

### Vault C: sEDU Leverage Vault (Advanced Strategy)

- Input Asset: $EDU (converted to $sEDU and then to $wstEDU)
- Mechanism:
  1. Stake $EDU to receive $sEDU
  2. Convert $sEDU to $wstEDU
  3. Deposit to Blend
  4. Borrow $EDU and loop
- Yield Sources:
  - Real yield (USDC) from wsEDU staking
  - BLEND emissions on lending and borrowing
- Requirements:
  - Blend must support $wsEDU as collateral
  - Oracle pricing for $wsEDU

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech

### üßÆ Points

- **TBD**: Decide how to distribute Blend points.
  - If we handle distribution, we‚Äôll need our own internal points system.
- **Q**: Do we want to build our own points system?

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

- **Browse Strategies**
  - Display TVL
  - Underlying asset (e.g. EDU, USDT)
  - Current APY
  - Target leverage

- **Vault Page**
  - View user vault position: current & target leverage
  - Deposit / Withdraw functionality  
    - **Q**: For withdrawals, do users input shares or an exact amount?
  - Show current user position
  - Historical APY  
    - Can fetch from Aave + calculate locally?

- Data source:  
  [Goldsky Subgraph](https://api.goldsky.com/api/public/project_cm040smxin6ju01x481kh0o8l/subgraphs/blend-edu/1.0.3/gn)

### üßæ Contracts

- Contract is based on **ERC4626**
  - Most functions behave like a standard ERC4626 vault
  - Should be **upgradeable** in case we need logic changes

- **Vault Rebalancing**
  - On deposit/withdraw, vault should rebalance to target leverage
    - This could increase or decrease overall leverage
  - Permit-based deposits not supported (WEDU/USDT don‚Äôt support permit)
  - **Q**: What happens if supply/borrow cap is hit?

- **View Functions**
  - `totalAssets()` ‚Üí Return net position on Aave + idle funds in vault
  - No caps for maxDeposit / maxRedeem etc.

- **Public Functions**
  - `rebalance()` ‚Üí Keeper can trigger rebalancing to target leverage

- **Admin Functions**
  - `setLeverage()` ‚Üí Adjust target leverage  
  - `pause()` / `unpause()` ‚Üí Disable/enable deposits or withdrawals  
  - `freeze()` ‚Üí Stop sending funds to Aave  
    - **Q**: Should we still allow deposits if Aave is frozen?  
  - `unwind()` ‚Üí Unwind all positions back to the vault (e.g. in case of a hack)  
  - `rescue()` ‚Üí **Q**: Do we want an emergency admin withdrawal feature?

- **Q**: Should we split permissions for each admin function?
  - Would be a nice-to-have for security.
