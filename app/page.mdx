# 🌞 Solen Protocol

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Solen Protocol** — a suite of DeFi strategies built on top of the EDUChain ecosystem. This protocol leverages **SailFish DEX** and **Blend Lending** to deliver high-yield, capital-efficient strategies for **$EDU** and **$USDT** holders.

---

## 🧭 Overview

The Yield Vault Protocol provides automated vaults where users can deposit assets and earn yield through recursive lending strategies and token incentives. Each vault is isolated, transparent, and optimized for capital efficiency and safety.

This is a public-facing DeFi app with its own frontend, branding, and on-chain smart contracts.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- Strategy-based vaults ($EDU, $USDT)
- Automated recursive lending loops
- Modular and configurable vaults
- Oracle integration (for wstEDU)
- Emergency pause and withdrawal controls
- On-chain analytics: APY, LTV, earnings

---

## 🏦 Vault Strategies

### Vault A: EDU Lending Loop (Vanilla)

- **Input Asset:** $EDU

**Looping Steps**
1. Deposit $EDU into Blend
2. Borrow $EDU (around 55% LTV)
3. Re-deposit borrowed $EDU
4. Repeat until target leverage (≈ 2.2x)

**Yield Sources**
- 5% BLEND rewards on deposits
- 5% BLEND rewards on borrows  
**Estimated APY:** ~17%

**Output**
- BLEND token rewards (claimable or stakeable)

---

### Vault B: USDT Positive Carry Loop (Stablecoin Strategy)

- **Input Asset:** $USDT

**Looping Steps**
1. Deposit $USDT into Blend
2. Borrow $USDT (around 75% LTV)
3. Re-deposit borrowed $USDT
4. Repeat until target leverage (≈ 4x)

**Yield Sources**
- 2.5% BLEND rewards on deposits
- 2.5% BLEND rewards on borrows  
**Estimated APY:** ~17.5%

**Output**
- BLEND token rewards (claimable or stakeable)

---

### Vault C: sEDU Leverage Vault (Advanced Strategy)

- **Input Asset:** $EDU → $sEDU → $wstEDU

**Mechanism**
1. Stake $EDU to receive $sEDU
2. Convert $sEDU to $wstEDU
3. Deposit $wstEDU into Blend
4. Borrow $EDU and loop

**Yield Sources**
- Real yield (**USDT**) from wstEDU staking
- BLEND emissions on lending and borrowing

**Requirements**
- Blend must support $wstEDU as collateral
- Oracle pricing for $wstEDU

## 🛠️ Tech

### 🧪 Points

- We will have our own points system, but will deploy it after launch.
- We'll retroactively allocate points based on historical vault activity.
- We will **not** manage $BLEND token distribution ourselves.  
- Instead, we will instruct Blend to route $BLEND rewards to user EOAs.

**To finalize:**
- Reward routing details
- Frequency of $BLEND distributions

---

### 🖥️ Frontend

#### Browse Strategies

- Display TVL
- Underlying asset (e.g. EDU, USDT)
- Current APY
- Target leverage

#### Vault Page

- View user vault position: current & target leverage
- Deposit / Withdraw functionality  
  > Withdrawals are based on **vault share units**, not USD or token amount
- Show current user position
- Show historical APY  
  > Net APY = BLEND rewards - borrow rate
- Use graph-based visualization (like Drift Fuel Vault UI)

### 📟 Contracts

#### ERC4626 Base

- Standard ERC4626 functions
- Upgradeable architecture

#### Vault Rebalancing

- Auto-rebalances to target leverage on deposit/withdraw
- If supply/borrow cap is hit:
  - Accept deposit
  - Hold idle asset in vault
  - Coordinate with Blend to raise caps

#### Operations Controls

- `pauseDeposits()` — stop new deposits
- `pauseWithdrawals()` — stop withdrawals
- `unwind()` — remove all funds from Blend
- `pauseTrading()` — stop Blend interaction but allow vault operations

#### Admin Functions

- `setLeverage()` — Adjust target leverage
- `pause()` / `unpause()`
- `unwind()` — Global unwind
- `rescue()` — Emergency admin withdrawal
- **Role-based permissions**: Optional for v1, recommended later

#### Withdrawals Disclaimer

> Withdrawals are processed instantly, unless the underlying protocol is fully utilized. This is rare, but possible.
